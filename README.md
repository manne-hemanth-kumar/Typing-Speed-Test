Typing Speed Test Web Application
This repository contains a simple web application for testing typing speed. Users can see a random quote, type it into a text area, and upon submission, the application calculates the time taken to type the quote accurately.

# How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/manne-hemanth-kumar/Typing-Speed-Test.git
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Start typing the quote displayed in the text area.

Once you have finished typing, click the "Submit" button.

If your typed sentence matches the displayed quote, the application will display the time taken to complete the typing test. Otherwise, it will indicate that the sentence was typed incorrectly.

To reset and take another typing test, click the "Reset" button.
